*** Backup of MobaXterm sources from MobaTek ***

The mid term goal is to unpack the sources and provide a compreensive set of tags that permit anyone to get the desired version of mobaXterm, as well as the desired plug-ins to eache version of MobaXterm.

A sercond goal is to provide the Makefile to eache of these tags.

Any help is greatly apreciated since I'm still learning Git and Github in the process.
